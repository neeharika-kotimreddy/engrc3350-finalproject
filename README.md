# Striving to Unify Our Climate Action: A Recommendation Report

This project aims to address the policy discrepancies between New York State (NYS), the City of Ithaca, and Cornell University regarding their climate and energy goals. By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, the project seeks to promote unified policies and actions toward achieving carbon neutrality and a sustainable future. This is my final project for the class ENGRC 3350: Organizational Communication for Engineers, which I took at Cornell in the summer of 2022. 

## Description
The report, which is uploaded as a pdf in this repo, outlines the shared climate goals of NYS, Ithaca, and Cornell University, while identifying key policy misalignments that hinder progress. It examines the impact of these disconnects and proposes actionable recommendations to promote stakeholder collaboration and policy alignment. The project advocates for a more cohesive approach to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035, emphasizing the role of distributed energy resources (DERs), renewable energy credits (RECs), and innovative policy frameworks. This initiative serves as a model for other institutions and governments seeking to resolve similar conflicts in their climate action plans.
